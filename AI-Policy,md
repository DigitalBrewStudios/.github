# DigitalBrewStudios General AI Policy

**A community guideline for responsible AI usage across all projects**

*Inspired by established code of conduct standards*

## Our Pledge

We welcome AI tools that accelerate development while maintaining our commitment to correctness, security, and maintainability across all DigitalBrewStudios projects.

Contributors using AI agree to:
- Verify AI-generated code works correctly
- Test fixes before submission  
- Understand the problem before proposing solutions
- Maintain our high standards of quality

## When AI Shines

AI is great for:

✅ Boilerplate generation (structs, configs, templates)
✅ Test scaffolding and examples
✅ Documentation drafting
✅ Algorithm exploration
✅ Routine task automation


## When AI Must Step Back

AI should **not**:

❌ Write production code without verification
❌ Modify business logic or security implementations
❌ Generate database migrations or Nix configurations
❌ Bypass testing or CI/CD pipelines
❌ Submit untested "fixes"
❌ Make assumptions about APIs or data flows


## AI Slop Doesn't Fly

**Reject criteria** (any of these = no merge):
❌ Fails to verify problem exists
❌ Untested changes
❌ Wrong assumptions about codebase
❌ Incomplete or misleading implementations
❌ Breaks build pipelines or conventions
❌ Lacks documentation or context


## Contribution Standards

**Every AI-assisted change includes:**

```markdown
## AI Usage Declaration
**AI used for:** [boilerplate generation, test scaffolding, etc.]
**Verification steps:**
- Reproduced issue: [details/link]
- Tests passing: [CI status]
- Build verified: [pipeline link]
- Manual review: ✅
```

## Enforcement
Projects using this policy:

1. Reject AI slop with constructive feedback
2. Require verification steps in all submissions
3. Enforce CI/CD testing requirements
4. Mentor contributors on proper usage
